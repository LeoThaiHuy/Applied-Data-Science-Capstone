# Applied-Data-Science-Capstone
This is the capstone project of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate and the Applied Data Science with Python Specialization on Coursera, in which I played the role of a Data Scientist for a business competing with SpaceX. I used Data Science methodology to predict the success of the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket landing. 

This project allowed me to use what I had learnt in earlier courses whilst also adding a project to my portfolio. I demonstrated proficiency in data science and machine learning techniques, used my skills in data collection, wrangling, analysis, and visualisation, built machine learning models in Python and SQL, evaluated their strengths and weaknesses, and identified the best model for predictive analysis.
