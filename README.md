# Applied-Data-Science-Capstone
This is the final course in the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate and the Applied Data Science with Python Specialization. It is a capstone project where I played the role of a Data Scientist for a startup competing with SpaceX. I used the Data Science methodology to predict the success of the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket landing. This project helped me apply what I had learned in previous courses and added a project to my portfolio. I demonstrated proficiency in data science and machine learning techniques, applied my skills in data collection, wrangling, analysis, and visualisation, created machine learning models using Python and SQL, evaluated their strengths and weaknesses, and identified the optimal model for predictive analysis.
